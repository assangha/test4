<!--
Build a new project using Angular JS and do the following:

App component:
- Add a link in the app component that leads to rendering the login component using this routing path "/login."


Login component:
- Create a new component for the login form (userName, password)
- Holds a function used to validate all the fields when the logic onSubmit event invokes the validation function when appropriate.
- The two fields can only contain letters and numbers and must not be empty
- Hash the password with bcrypt (bcryptjs) 
- show the validation error message at the top of the form 
- if the login successfully will be redirected to this path "/contactus"
- Protect your application by using JWT, so unauthorized user can not access this path "/contactus"
- We assume the user information who willing to use our application are:

{      "userName": "bob",      "password": "myPassword"  }

Contactus component:
- Create a new component for the contact us form (name, email, message)
- Holds a function used to validate all the fields when the logic onSubmit event invokes the validation function when appropriate.
- All form elements can not be empty
- show errror message the moment the user violates the validation rule at the top of the form


Netlify:
- Deploy the app with Netlifyâ€™s
- write the URL to your published website and your GitHub Repository in the answer box with your scripts


Note: The timestamp of pushing the changes from your local repository to the remote one should be during your exam time; if not, you will get a Zero
